### Description

Implementation of the robust tools to 1) visualize and perform inference
on the autocorrelation structure of time series of functional data
objects, and 2) perform goodness-of-fit tests for popular functional
time series models.

### Installation

Install the **R**
[**`devtools`**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package
and run

``` r
devtools::install_github("veritasmih/FTSgof")
```
