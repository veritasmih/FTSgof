Description: The FTSgof package offers comprehensive tools for the analysis of functional
    time series (FTS) data, focusing on white noise hypothesis testing and
    goodness-of-fit evaluations. It includes implementations of functional
    autoregressive (FAR) and ARCH/GARCH models, alongside functions for
    simulating data and advanced visualization techniques, such as 3D
    rainbow plots.
