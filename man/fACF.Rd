\title{Functional Autocorrelation Function (fACF) Plot}
\usage{
fACF(f_data, H = 20, alpha = 0.05, wwn_bound = FALSE, M = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_data}{A \eqn{J \times N} matrix of functional time series data, where \eqn{J} is the number of discrete points in a grid and \eqn{N} is the sample size.}

\item{H}{A positive integer value. The maximum lag for which to compute the coefficients and confidence bounds.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the significance level to be used for the confidence bounds.}

\item{wwn_bound}{A Boolean value allowing the user to turn on the WWN bound. FALSE by default. Speeds down computation when TRUE.}

\item{M}{A positive integer value. The number of Monte-Carlo simulations used to compute the confidence bounds under the WWN assumption. 
If \eqn{M = NULL, M = \text{floor}((\max(150 - N, 0) + \max(100 - J, 0) + (J / \sqrt{2})))},
ensuring that the number of Monte Carlo simulations is adequate based on the dataset size.}
}
\value{
Plot of the estimated functional autocorrelation coefficients for lags \eqn{h \in 1:H} with the WWN
\eqn{100 (1-\alpha)\%} upper confidence bound for each lag, as well as the constant SWN
\eqn{100 (1-\alpha)\%} upper confidence bound.
}
\description{
This function provides a graphical summary of the fACF of a functional time series (FTS) across different time lags \eqn{h = 1:H}.
It also plots the \eqn{100 (1-\alpha)\%} confidence bounds, developed under both weak white noise (WWN) and strong white noise (SWN) assumptions for all lags \eqn{h = 1:H}.
}
\details{
This function computes and plots functional autocorrelation coefficients at lag \eqn{h}, for \eqn{h \in 1:H}. Given functional observations, \eqn{X_1,\ldots, X_N}, the sample autocovariance kernel at lag \eqn{h} can be computed by
\deqn{
\hat{\gamma}_{N,h}(t,s)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N-h} (X_i(t)-\bar{X}_N(t))(X_{i+h}(s)-\bar{X}_N(s)),\ \ \ \ 0 \le h < N,
}
where \eqn{\bar{X}_N(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N X_i(t)}. Then, the fACF at lag \eqn{h} is defined by measuring
the magnitude (\eqn{L^2}-norm) of the lagged autocovariance kernel \eqn{\hat\gamma_{N,h}}:
\deqn{
\hat\rho_h =\frac{\|\hat{\gamma}_{N,h}\|}{\int \hat{\gamma}_{N,0}(t,t)dt}, \ \ \ \ \|\hat{\gamma}_{N,h}\|^2=\iint  \hat{\gamma}_{N,h}^2(t,s) dtds.
}
This function plots estimated asymptotic \eqn{100 (1-\alpha)\%} confidence bounds under the WWN assumption.
Additionally, it computes similar (constant) bounds under the SWN assumption.
